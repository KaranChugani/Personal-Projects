## Machine learning for Human Activity recognition

In this project I used a K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify different human activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Classifying clothes with a CNN

For this project I trained and tested a Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify images of 10 different clothes items belonging to the Fashion MNIST dataset.
