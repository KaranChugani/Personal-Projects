## Machine learning for Human Activity recognition

In this project I used a K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify different human activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Classifying clothes with a CNN

For this project I trained and tested a Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify images of 10 different clothes items belonging to the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Keras implementation of EEGNET for Movement intention classification

Built the EEGNet model described in "Convolutional neural networks in EEG analysis" [1] using Keras. The aim was to train them model to discriminate motor intention from EEG signals from the BCI Competion IV Dataset 2a.
