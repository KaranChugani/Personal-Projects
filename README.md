## Keras implementation of EEGNET for Movement intention classification

Built the EEGNet model described in [1] using Keras with the aim of creating an end to end neural network that could discriminate motor intention from EEG signals. 

## Classifying clothes with a CNN

For this project I trained and tested a Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify images of 10 different clothes items belonging to the Fashion MNIST dataset.


## Machine learning for Human Activity recognition

In this project I used a K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify different human activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data.
